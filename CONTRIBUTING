Docker images are used to run tests in.  Use,

```bash
    make image-<python-version>
```

where `python-version` is the version of Python you wish to test with.

```bash
    make all-images
```

will make images for the `2.7`, `3.5`, `3.6`, `3.7` and `3.8` versions of
Python.

Use,

```bash
    make shell-<python-version>
```

will place you in `bash` in a Docker container using the specified version of
Python.

Use,

```bash
    make test-<python-version>
```

will execute tests in a Docker container using the specified Python version.
You can use the `all-tests` target to run the tests under all the above Python
versions.
